Archiving materials I've studied throughout the years. Hope it helps!
#For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar #to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

#Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!
